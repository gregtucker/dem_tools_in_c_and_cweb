# dem_tools_in_c_and_cweb
Various DEM (Digital Elevation Model) analysis tools for hydrology and geomorphology

This repo contains a suite of programs I wrote as a graduate student and (later) postdoc to perform various kinds of DEM analysis. This was done in the 1990s. Those files ending in .c are of course written in C. Those ending in .w are written in CWEB. I offer these to anyone who may find them helpful, with the caveat that I haven't used them in a very long time. As best I recall, the DEM size must be hard-coded.
